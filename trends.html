                            Cloud computing revolutionizes the delivery of computing resources and services over the
                            internet, enabling on-demand access to scalable and flexible solutions. It encompasses
                            infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and software as a service
                            (SaaS), providing organizations with the agility, scalability, and cost-efficiency to
                            innovate and grow. By offloading infrastructure management to cloud providers, businesses
                            focus on developing and deploying applications, accelerating time-to-market and reducing
                            operational overhead. With hybrid and multi-cloud architectures gaining prominence, cloud
                            computing fosters innovation, collaboration, and digital transformation across industries,
                            driving economies of scale and democratizing access to technology.

                            RPA automates repetitive and rule-based tasks using software robots, streamlining business
                            processes and freeing up human workers for higher-value activities. It encompasses data
                            entry, document processing, and workflow automation across various industries, enhancing
                            efficiency, accuracy, and scalability. By mimicking human actions and interactions with
                            digital systems, RPA eliminates errors, reduces cycle times, and enhances compliance in
                            routine tasks. As organizations embrace digital transformation and seek to optimize their
                            operations, RPA emerges as a strategic enabler, augmenting human capabilities and driving
                            productivity gains in an increasingly automated and data-driven world.
